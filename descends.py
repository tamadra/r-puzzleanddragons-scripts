[](/1119 "Awoken Sandalphon")[Awoken Sandalphon](http://puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1119) Not a bad healer lead, he kind of fixes the HP issue but gives up some burst.  His Active isn't so bad if you can skill that sucker up, 25 turns is a really long time to charge, but if you can get it to 11, it should be pretty good.  Again, fixing the defensive issues of healer teams for some of their burst.  I'd still probably go for Shynee though, most of the time you really just want to one-hit the floors you need, but I suppose you can bring both this guy AND Shynee if you have two floors worth of bursting.
